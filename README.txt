From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This is my first project in HTML and CSS.
The project is to create the google home page

What I want to learn in HTML :
- Create lists
- Create a simple form
- Create a button
- Create a header
- Create a footer
- Use div tag

What I want to learn in CSS :
- Start using id and class in a separate file
- Learn few basics properties
- Experiment with padding/border/margin
- Experiment with position (absolute, flex...)
